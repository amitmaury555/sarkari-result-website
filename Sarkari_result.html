            <P>Why Should I Consider a Government Job?</P>
            In India, a Sarkari Naukri (or an Indian government job) is highly sought-after. It's the ultimate career
            goal, offering long-term security, good benefits, and friendly co-workers.
            <br><br>

            <br><br>
            According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt. Ltd. (CMIE), the unemployment rate in India
            increased from 6.5% in November 2020 to 7.75% in October 2021. In this fluctuating market, there has been an
            increase in the demand for the stability and permanence offered by a Sarkari Naukri.
            <br><br>
            In addition, government jobs in India can be pretty lucrative offering competitive salaries, benefits, and
            pensions. Some of the highest-paid jobs in the Indian government include the Indian Administrative Services
            (IAS), Indian Foreign Services (IFS), and Indian Police Services (IPS).
            <br><br>
            Keep in mind that these jobs are also highly competitive with a complex application process!
        </div>
        <div class="para3">
            <p>What Kind of Government Jobs Can I Get?</p>
            There are a wide variety of government jobs in India. It depends on your interests, but a job in the Indian
            government can range from policy-making, public administration, military, law, engineering, and even
            teaching. Some of the more highly-paid and in-demand positions are discussed below to give you a sense of
            their requirements and salary expectations.
            <br><br>
            1. Indian Administrative Services (IAS) and Indian Foreign Services (IFS) Jobs : The role of an IAS officer
            may include advising the ministers on various policy issues, implementing policies of the government,
            collecting revenue, and supervising public spending. An IFS officer manages foreign relations in India with
            more than 160 Indian Diplomatic Missions and International Organizations around the world. The starting
            monthly salary of an IAS or IFS officer is about INR 56,100.
            <br><br>
            2. Indian Police Services (IPS) Jobs : A role with the IPS involves safeguarding the public, maintaining law
            and order, and detecting and preventing crime. The role can be with the various agencies and branches
            including the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW), Intelligence Bureau (IB), Central Bureau of Investigation
            (CBI), and Criminal Investigation Department (CID). To be eligible for a job with IPS, there are additional
            requirements, including physical standards. Physical eligibility includes minimum height for men and women,
            minimum chest girth for men and women, restriction on vision impairments including myopia limited to less
            than -4.00, and hyper myopia not exceeding +4.00. According to Payscale, an entry-level police constable
            with less than 1-year experience can earn an average total compensation of INR 255,094. This includes tips,
            bonuses, and overtime pay.
            <br><br>
            3. Banking Jobs :The banking sector is one of the fastest-growing sectors in India. It's not surprising that
            jobs in government-approved banks such as the State Bank of India (SBI), Allahabad Bank, HDFC, and ICICI are
            highly sought after. A job in the banking sector could either be a clerical position such as typists, data
            entry operators, cashiers, or clerks or a probationary officer (PO) role. As a PO, the candidate will be
            under probation during the training period and will be hired following the probation based on performance.
            During the training period, the candidate will be trained in accounting, finance, billing, investment, and
            revenue collection. A PO role allows opportunities for career growth to middle and senior management based
            on performance and additional examinations. The starting monthly salary of a PO is about INR 57,000
            including allowances.
            <br><br>
            4. Defence Jobs : Jobs with the National Defence Academy (NDA) can be in various departments, such as Army,
            Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, etc. A job in the NDA comes with strict restrictions on age, physical, and
            vision standards. Cadet trainees receive a stipend of INR 56,100 per month. Allowances and promotions will
            increase this salary. There are also several agricultural, engineering, and research jobs with their own set
            of rules and requirements. These can get very complicated, but Sarkari Result does all the work for you and
            lists the various jobs ranging from a Rajasthani police constable to Allahabad High Court Review Officer.
            Each job posting contains all the details you would need to be able to apply for the position with ease.

            <p>Sarkari Result 2022 : SarkariResult.Com</p>
            India has witnessed a high demand for Government jobs for many decades. People prefer Government jobs as
            their career option considering the wide variety of benefits that are associated with these. ‘Sarkari
            Naukri’ is a dream for millions of people across the nation, and only a few are lucky to land up with such
            jobs. People tend to take pride in having a Sarkari or Government job.
            <br><br>
            Government jobs hold the kind of authority not found in private jobs. These also offer job security for a
            lifetime, and hence a lot of youth prefer them. Getting into a Government job requires a person to go
            through multiple levels of tests. These include a written examination, interview and sometimes even physical
            examination. These are competitive exams, and millions of people appear for these exams to get into a
            coveted Government job.
        </div>
        <div class="para6">
            <p>How Competitive Is the Government Job Market?</p>
            There is no doubt that finding an Indian government job is highly competitive. The Times of India said it
            best when they said that the numbers are staggering:
            <br><br>
            2.3 million applications for 368 peon positions in Uttar Pradesh.
            <br><br>
            2.5 million applications for 6,000 positions in Bengal
            <br><br>
            200,000 applications for 1,137 positions as police constables in Maharashtra.
            <br><br>
            When the Ministry of Railways started recruiting for around 63,000 positions, they received more than 19
            million (1.9 crores) job applications.
            <br><br>
            With COVID-19, the competition has only increased because of the drop in the number of people hired by the
            government. The central government hired 119,000 people in 2021 which is a reduction in almost 32,000 jobs.
            There was a similar drop in 2021 of almost 107,000 people hired by the state government. This creates an
            extremely competitive environment. Getting up-to-date information on the latest jobs on Sarkari Result and
            understanding eligibility requirements can help you stand out from the crowd. These are of course some of
            the most coveted roles in India and are extremely competitive.
        </div>
        <div class="para7">
            <p>Sarkari Exam for Government Jobs</p>
            Sarkari or Government exams are conducted for various positions in the state as well as central Government.
            There are various groups in <a href="https://www.sarkariresult.com/latestjob/"> Government jobs</a> and candidates can apply for either of these groups, depending
            on their qualifications. Group A mostly comprises of managerial roles and are considered to be the highest
            level of jobs. Group B is for Gazetted officers. To clear the Group B exam, one has to make the UPSC exam.
            Most seats under Group B are filled via promotions, so only limited seats are left for entrance via exam.
